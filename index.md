I'm **Hasan Shaikh**, a <span class="important-text">Clinical Data Scientist</span> at the <span class="important-text">Quantitative Imaging Research and Artificial Intelligence Lab (QIRAIL)</span>, <span class="important-text">Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore</span>, working at the intersection of medical imaging, machine learning, and radiation oncology.

My research addresses a fundamental challenge: how do we build AI systems that deliver precision oncology in hospitals where advanced imaging infrastructure—PET scans, MRI, genomic sequencing—isn't readily available? In resource-constrained healthcare settings, CT-based radiomics and deep learning offer a methodologically sound alternative. The question driving my work is simple but critical: can we achieve world-class cancer care without world-class budgets?

## The Path Here

My journey from Lucknow to Aligarh to Vellore has been shaped by a consistent focus on solving problems where the clinical need is greatest. During my master's at AMU (CGPA 8.80/10), I worked on multimodal survival prediction models, learning early that the most impactful research happens when you understand both the technical challenges and the clinical constraints.

Before joining QIRAIL, I spent time in quantitative finance at STARlab Capital, designing volatility-based trading strategies. That experience—backtesting models under real-world uncertainty, optimizing risk-reward ratios, improving ROI by 52%—taught me principles that translate directly to clinical ML: the importance of robust validation, the danger of overfitting to pristine datasets, and the discipline required to build systems that work when it matters.

At CMC Vellore, I'm now part of a team proving that rigorous cancer research doesn't require unlimited resources. It requires methodological discipline, creative problem-solving, and a willingness to tackle hard problems with finite constraints.

## What I Do

I develop machine learning models for cancer outcome prediction and automated tumor segmentation, focusing on approaches that work in real clinical environments—not just research labs. My work spans radiomics-based prognostication, 3D deep learning for automated segmentation, and building large-scale imaging infrastructure that enables reproducible multi-institutional research.

The technical approach emphasizes reproducibility and clinical translatability: FAIR-compliant data pipelines, rigorous multi-institutional validation, and deployment-ready architectures. I work with tools like PyRadiomics, PyTorch, nnU-Net, and cloud infrastructure (AWS S3) to build end-to-end systems that go from DICOM images to clinical predictions.

But the real work isn't just building models—it's ensuring they function reliably where they're needed most, not just where they're easiest to deploy.

## What Drives This Work

There's a gap between what's possible in well-funded academic centers and what's accessible in most hospitals. In India, over a million people are diagnosed with cancer each year. Most won't have access to the imaging protocols, treatment planning systems, or clinical trials available in Boston or London. 

My goal is to prove that this gap isn't inevitable. That CT-based AI can achieve clinically actionable performance. That open-source tools and FAIR data practices can enable research across institutions. That precision oncology doesn't require unlimited budgets—it requires the right questions, rigorous methodology, and tools designed for the environments they'll actually be used in.

## Looking Forward

I'm actively seeking PhD positions in Medical AI, Computer Vision, or Biomedical Engineering for Fall 2025/Spring 2026. I'm interested in programs that value translational research, methodological rigor, and real-world clinical impact.

I'm also open to collaborations on multi-institutional validation studies, clinical deployment of radiomics models, and any work addressing healthcare AI in resource-limited settings. If your research intersects with quantitative imaging, oncology outcomes, or building AI systems that work where they're needed most—I'd welcome a conversation.
