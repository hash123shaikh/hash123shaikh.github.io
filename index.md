## The Question That Drives Me

<div class="quote-box">
"What if the AI model that saves a life tomorrow is being trained in a hospital today‚Äînot in Silicon Valley, but in Vellore, India?"
</div>

I'm **Hasan Shaikh**, and I believe this question isn't hypothetical anymore. It's happening. Right now.

I'm a <span class="important-text">Project Assistant</span> at the <span class="important-text">Quantitative Imaging Research and Artificial Intelligence Lab (QIRAIL)</span> at <span class="important-text">Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore</span>, where we're doing something audacious: **democratizing precision oncology for a country of 1.4 billion people.**

## Why This Matters (And Why You Should Care)

Every year, **over a million Indians are diagnosed with cancer**. Most won't have access to PET-MRI scans, genomic profiling, or the cutting-edge treatments available in Boston or London. But here's the thing: **they shouldn't need them.**

What if we could predict treatment outcomes from a simple CT scan? What if we could segment tumors as accurately as expert radiologists‚Äîbut in seconds, not hours? What if we could build AI systems that work in resource-limited hospitals, where every rupee counts and every decision carries weight?

That's not a distant dream. **That's my day job.**

From Lucknow to Aligarh to Vellore, my journey has been shaped by one realization: **the most important problems in AI aren't the ones that make headlines‚Äîthey're the ones that save lives in places the headlines forget.**

## What I'm Building

I work at the intersection of **radiomics, deep learning, and clinical translation**, turning medical images into actionable intelligence:

üî¨ **Radiomics-Based Risk Stratification**: Predicting locoregional recurrence in head & neck cancer using CT-based biomarkers and metaheuristic feature selection  
üß† **3D nnU-Net Automated Segmentation**: Building CT-only models that work where MRI isn't available  
üè• **CHAVI‚ÄîIndia's First National Oncology Imaging Biobank**: Curating 300+ anonymized cases with FAIR-compliant pipelines for multi-institutional research  
‚ö° **Clinical AI Deployment**: Creating tools that doctors can trust and patients can access‚Äîtoday, not in five years

But here's what really keeps me awake at night: **How do we make these tools so good, so accessible, and so robust that they become standard of care‚Äînot just in CMC Vellore, but in every district hospital across India?**

---

## The Impossible Goal

I don't want to publish papers that gather dust in journals. I don't want to build models that only work on pristine datasets. **I want to prove that world-class cancer care doesn't require world-class wealth.**

From my time in fintech (yes, volatility-based trading strategies) to my work in medical AI, I've learned one thing: **the best solutions emerge when you refuse to accept constraints as fate.**

My "impossible" goal? **To be part of the generation that makes precision oncology as accessible in rural India as it is in MD Anderson or Memorial Sloan Kettering.**

## Why You're Here (And What Happens Next)

If you've read this far, you're probably one of three people:

1. **A researcher** who thinks "This person gets it‚Äîlet's collaborate"
2. **A PhD program director** thinking "We need someone with this fire"
3. **Someone with resources** wondering "How do I help make this happen?"

To all three: **I'm listening.**

I'm actively seeking **PhD opportunities in Medical AI, Computer Vision, or Biomedical Engineering** for Fall 2025/Spring 2026. I'm open to **research collaborations, speaking engagements, and conversations with anyone who believes technology should serve humanity‚Äînot the other way around.**

<h3><span class="collaboration-text">Let's Build Something That Matters</span></h3>
<p>The future of precision oncology won't be written by those with the biggest budgets‚Äîit'll be coded by those with the biggest questions and the courage to answer them.</p>
<p><span class="collaboration-text">If you're working on translational AI, clinical deployment, or just believe that "impossible" is a challenge rather than a verdict‚Äîreach out.</span></p>
