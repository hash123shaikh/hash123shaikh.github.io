> *"The real purpose of research is not just discovery — but translation. That's where science becomes service."*

I'm **Hasan Shaikh**, a Clinical Data Scientist at the <span class="important-text">Quantitative Imaging Research and Artificial Intelligence Lab (QIRAIL)</span>, <span class="important-text">Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore</span>, India. I work at the intersection of <span class="important-text">cancer imaging, radiomics, and machine learning</span>, with a focus on <span class="important-text">head & neck cancer</span>. I build end-to-end pipelines—from DICOM data curation and segmentation to risk modeling and clinician-facing dashboards—aimed at delivering trustworthy, explainable tools for patient care.
