> *"The real purpose of research is not just discovery — but translation. That's where science becomes service."*

I'm **Hasan Shaikh**, a Clinical Data Scientist at the **Quantitative Imaging Research and Artificial Intelligence Lab (QIRAIL)**, **Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore**, India. I work at the intersection of **cancer imaging**, **radiomics**, and **machine learning**, with a focus on **head & neck cancer**. I build end-to-end pipelines—from **DICOM data curation** and **segmentation** to **risk modeling** and **clinician-facing dashboards**—aimed at delivering trustworthy, explainable tools for patient care.

## Current Research Focus

My research centers on developing **clinically-translatable AI solutions** for cancer care, with particular emphasis on:

**Radiomics-Based Recurrence Prediction**  
Developing robust ML pipelines for predicting locoregional recurrence in head & neck cancer patients using CT-based radiomics features, with focus on feature stability, model calibration, and uncertainty quantification.

**Automated Tumor Segmentation**  
Implementing and validating 3D nnU-Net and MedSAM for automated segmentation of tumors and organs-at-risk, emphasizing quality assurance protocols and clinical workflow integration.

**Clinical Decision Support Systems**  
Building lightweight web applications (FastAPI + React) that surface AI predictions and explanations at point-of-care, ensuring trustworthy and interpretable AI deployment.

**Medical Data Governance**  
Designing comprehensive DICOM data curation pipelines for multi-institutional research, ensuring GDPR/HIPAA compliance and research reproducibility.
