> *"The real purpose of research is not just discovery — but translation. That's where science becomes service."*

I'm **Hasan Shaikh**, a Clinical Data Scientist at the **Quantitative Imaging Research and Artificial Intelligence Lab (QIRAIL)**, **Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore**, India. I work at the intersection of **cancer imaging**, **radiomics**, and **machine learning**, with a focus on **head & neck cancer**. I build end-to-end pipelines—from **DICOM data curation** and **segmentation** to **risk modeling** and **clinician-facing dashboards**—aimed at delivering trustworthy, explainable tools for patient care.


## Research Interests

- **Radiomics** (CT feature engineering)
- **Auto-segmentation** (3D nnU-Net, MedSAM)  
- **Risk prediction & survival modeling**

- **Explainable ML** (attribution, calibration, uncertainty)
- **Deep learning for medical imaging**
- **LLMs for clinical text/report alignment**
- **Radiation oncology data curation** (DICOM, Orthanc/XNAT)
