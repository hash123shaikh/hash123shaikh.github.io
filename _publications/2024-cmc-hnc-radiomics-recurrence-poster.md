**Abstract.** Head & neck cancers have a high risk of recurrence despite curative therapy. Standard clinical factors offer limited predictive power for identifying patients at high risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR). We evaluated whether CT-based radiomics features combined with ML can stratify one-year LRR risk in a prospective cohort. Early results indicate that a Naive Bayes model provided the best balance between training and testing performance. Findings are preliminary and will be revisited as the dataset matures.
