**Abstract.** Cancer survival prediction is essential for guiding oncologists in making informed decisions about patient care and determining prognosis. AI techniques—particularly machine learning and deep learning—can leverage complex imaging and clinical data to enable accurate, early predictions. Imaging-based models capture clinically meaningful patterns, while ML-enhanced NLP interprets unstructured notes and reports, improving decision-making. This chapter surveys recent advances and practical integration pathways, highlighting progress in explainable AI, personalized medicine, and real-time monitoring to support treatment decisions, patient management, and optimized resource allocation.
