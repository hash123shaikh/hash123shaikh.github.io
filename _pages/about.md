> *“The real purpose of research is not just discovery — but translation. That’s where science becomes service.”*

Welcome! I’m **Hasan Shaikh**, a passionate AI researcher working at the **Quantitative Imaging Research and Artificial Intelligence Lab (QIRAIL)**, Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore, India. My work lies at the intersection of **cancer imaging**, **radiomics**, and **deep learning**, with a vision to bring **real-world clinical impact** through data-driven solutions.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🔬 Currently involved in **prospective clinical studies** to predict **locoregional recurrence** in **head and neck cancer** using CT imaging and radiomics.
- 🧠 Special focus on **explainable machine learning**, **automated segmentation**, and integrating **AI into clinical workflows**.
- 🛠️ Skilled in Python, PyRadiomics, scikit-learn, nnUNet, MedSAM, and full-stack development tools like React and FastAPI.
- 🤝 Collaborating across departments, including Radiation Oncology, Computer Science, and AI research labs.
- 🧪 Past projects include **multimodal survival prediction**, deep learning pipelines, and feature optimization using **metaheuristic algorithms** (PSO, WOA, GWO).

I’m committed to combining **domain knowledge**, **technical skill**, and **clinical understanding** to develop systems that can genuinely assist doctors and improve patient care.

## 🔍 Current Research Focus

- **Radiomics-Based Recurrence Prediction**  
  Developing robust ML pipelines for analyzing texture, shape, and intensity features from CT images to stratify recurrence risk.

- **AI-Driven Tumor Segmentation**  
  Applying state-of-the-art models like **nnUNet** and **MedSAM** for accurate and reproducible tumor volume segmentation in clinical datasets.

- **Clinical Dashboard Integration**  
  Building end-to-end dashboards with backend (FastAPI) + frontend (React) to bring predictions and risk assessments into the hands of clinicians.

- **Model Explainability & Generalization**  
  Exploring feature attribution, cohort variation, and domain shifts across datasets to ensure models remain reliable and understandable.
