> *"The real purpose of research is not just discovery — but translation. That's where science becomes service."*

I'm **Hasan Shaikh**, a Clinical Data Scientist at the **Quantitative Imaging Research and Artificial Intelligence Lab (QIRAIL)**, **Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore**, India. I work at the intersection of **cancer imaging**, **radiomics**, and **machine learning**, with a focus on **head & neck cancer**. I build end-to-end pipelines—from **DICOM data curation** and **segmentation** to **risk modeling** and **clinician-facing dashboards**—aimed at delivering trustworthy, explainable tools for patient care.


## Current Research Focus

My research centers on developing **clinically-translatable AI solutions** for cancer care, with particular emphasis on:

- **Radiomics-based recurrence prediction** in head & neck cancer using robust ML pipelines that account for feature stability, model calibration, and uncertainty quantification
- **Automated tumor/structure segmentation** using state-of-the-art deep learning models (3D nnU-Net, MedSAM) with rigorous quality assurance protocols
- **Clinical decision support systems** that surface AI predictions and explanations at point-of-care through lightweight, user-friendly interfaces
- **Medical data governance** including DICOM workflows, anonymization protocols, and multi-institutional research infrastructure
